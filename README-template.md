### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox



### What I learned

In this project i use at the first time the relative units for the text. I practice the knowledge with flexbox. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


```css
h1{
font-weight: 300;
font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif; /*What is the correct font-family?*/
font-size:1.25rem;
padding-top:0.8em;

}
}


### Continued development

I want to create other newbie project, to exercise the HTML, CSS and JS basic knowledge.
